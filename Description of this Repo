                                                  ####Pandas for Everyone: Python Data Analysis####

I took MIS 4390 from my university, which explored Python for quantitative methods and practical techniques of Business and Data Analytics.

I wanted to share the exercises we did that utilized this specific programming language and showcase my understanding of it through set of problems.

We used the computer program, Anaconda, and then Jupyter within the program. We had our own CourseData.zip file directed into its destination directory 
to help navigate to the set of data and files we want to access and work with the Python language to enter codes specific to what we need to achieve.

Just wanted to show this out there, for I found these interesting to work with and useful to know.

These are meant to serve as a guide and showcase my learning experience within the course :)

Note:
The MIS3320 CourseData directory (Has all the Python data and codes) contains the following directories: 
        o	The data directory has all the data. 
        o	The notebook directory is where the codes are saved (where my actual exercises are). 
        o	The textbook examples directory contains the source codes worked from the textbook and relates to the exercises.
